This is an F-22 cockpit that I made for racerretrocoder's F-22 for Flightgear (https://github.com/racerretrocoder/Flightgear-F-22A-Raptor).

##### If you want all the pieces seperate then use the OBJ. The STL is mainly there for the preview on Github (it is the same as the OBJ just not as useful).

### Changes & Upcoming
Now it has all the switches & knobs. I have them as a separete file incase they aren't wanted. Sadly it still lacks a joystick because the one I made turned out a failure.

Next up is nameing all the switches and knobs properly, then making the joystick. I'm trying to use the one from racerretrocoder by just patching it, but we'll see how it goes.
