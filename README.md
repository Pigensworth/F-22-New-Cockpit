This is an F-22 cockpit that I made for racerretrocoder's F-22 for Flightgear (https://github.com/racerretrocoder/Flightgear-F-22A-Raptor).

### Changes & Upcoming
This version has an airvent and all the console thingies. Sadly it still lacks a joystick because the one I made turned out a failure.

I'm currently working on adding all the switches.
